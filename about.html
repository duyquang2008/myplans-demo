        <h1>Qang's web</h1>
        <p>This website is created by Quang and in programming languages ​​Css and Html. To speak and introduce myself. Thanks for stopping by</p>
        <p>this website was created as part of community engagement activities at the start of the incubation phase in its W3C Strategy Funnel 
        <p>development, and has been kept deliberately separate from Away Team's company website to emphasise the open nature of the format.</p>
        <p>further details about this site can be found in the Terms and Conditions and Privacy and Cookies Policy.</p>
        <p>through this website, I aim to inspire others, showcase my projects, and explore the endless possibilities of web development. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, I hope you find something valuable here.</p>
        <p>feel free to reach out to me with any questions, suggestions, or just to say hello. Let's create something amazing together!</p>
        <p>thank you for embarking on this journey with me. Together, let's push the boundaries of what's possible and create something extraordinary.</p>
